For this activity the starting 'stock' website was a bit messy and missing some basic semantics, I did my best to clean up the code and made it easier to read and understand.

I edited the semantics in the 'index.html' to help clear out the many messy 'divs' to better define them as to what they really were 'header', 'article', 'aside', 'footer'.

For the stylesheet 'style.css' I shortened up a lot of the redundancies and grouped together all the classes that shared the same style, thus making the code look both cleaner and shorter.
